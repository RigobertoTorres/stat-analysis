# stat-analysis
The idea is to sort a large amount of data and perform some statistical analysis on it

Version 1.00
The project currently uses a radix sort to sort an array of integers, though research has shown that simply using a quicksort may be more effecient (atleast more flexible) depending on the set of data

At the moment the stat analysis methods I plan to complete are:
  -Mean (Completed)
  -Median (Completed)
  -Mode
  -Range (Completed)
  -Standard Deviation
  -Q1, Q2, Q3
  -
